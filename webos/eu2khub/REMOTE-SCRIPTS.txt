Remote scripts/styles referenced in the project (download these and place them under eu2khub/assets/js or assets/css, then update the local imports or uncomment the script tags):

1) Firebase app
   https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.10.0/firebase-app.js
   Local path used: ./assets/js/firebase-app-11.10.0.js

2) Firebase analytics
   https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.10.0/firebase-analytics.js
   Local path placeholder: ./assets/js/firebase-analytics-11.10.0.remote.js (saved copy)
   Note: analytics intentionally neutralized. To re-enable, replace with canonical bundle and uncomment imports in HTML.

3) Firebase firestore
   https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.10.0/firebase-firestore.js
   Local path: ./assets/js/firebase-firestore-11.10.0.tmp.js (rewritten to import local firebase-app)
   After verification you can move/rename tmp to the canonical filename.

4) Google Fonts (Roboto)
   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:... (various queries)
   Local path: ./assets/css/roboto.css (fonts must be downloaded and placed in ./assets/fonts/)

5) Microsoft Clarity
   https://scripts.clarity.ms/0.8.27/clarity.js
   Telemetry endpoint: https://o.clarity.ms/collect
   Local placeholder: ./assets/js/clarity-s6n7qpfkv4.js (stubbed)

6) jsDelivr / Material Web
   https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@material/web/... (referenced in material-web-all.js docs)
   Consider vendorizing @material/web into ./assets/js/@material/web/

7) Google Tag Manager (used by analytics bundle)
   https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js

8) Firebase installs / config endpoints (used by analytics/app):
   https://firebase.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/-/apps/{app-id}/webConfig
   https://firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com/...

9) Any other external URLs spotted:
   - Microsoft Clarity image ping: https://c.clarity.ms/c.gif
   - External API used by youhub-test / translations: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent

Instructions:
- Download the canonical files for 1-3 and save into the paths indicated.
- For fonts, download Roboto woff2/ttf files and place them under eu2khub/assets/fonts/ matching the filenames used in ./assets/css/roboto.css.
- After placing files locally, remove the "remote" suffix and/or update imports in HTML/CSS to point to local files and remove the comments that block the imports.
- If a downloaded bundle contains top-level imports referencing other CDN modules (e.g., firebase-app), update those import specifiers to the local relative paths (./firebase-app-11.10.0.js).

If you want, I can download these canonical files for you and place them into the repo (I already downloaded Firestore into firebase-firestore-11.10.0.tmp.js). Tell me which ones to fetch and I'll add them.
